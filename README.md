# JS-Pass_gen
Password gen made from Java scrip
## Description

JavaScrip password generator

Functional little code used to generate a password with all characters. Fun little project we had to do that I had fun building! Learned that I need to specify literally every character in order for the code to work, jeez... 

## Usage

You can use this to generate a darn safe password. Even I couldn't guess these passwords.

## Credits

Enlisted help from my instructor Justin, TA Robert, and some random stackoverflow posts. Without Stackoverflow, I wouldn't have figured out that I need every darn character specified!
